If this PR makes visible UI changes, an image of the finished UI can help reviewers and casual
observers understand the context of the changes. A before image is optional and
can be included at the submitter's discretion.

Consider using an animated image to show an entire workflow instead of using multiple images. You may want to use [GIPHY CAPTURE](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) for this! ðŸ“¸
