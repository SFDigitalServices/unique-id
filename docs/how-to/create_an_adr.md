# How To Create an ADR

Significant architectural decisions are recorded in the project's `docs/adr` directory.

We are using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to manage ADRs. There are more usage instructions for that tool [on its homepage](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tool).

## Create a New ADR

```console
$  adr new Implement as Unix shell scripts
```

The above command will generate a file at `docs/adr/xxxx-implement-as-unix-shell-scripts.md` that can be filled in with decision details.
